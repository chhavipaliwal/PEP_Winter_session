//ternary operator
//The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?),
let page = "Home";
console.log(`class=${page === "Home" ? "master" : "secondary"}`);
// a truthy expression followed by a colon (:), and a falsy expression.
//The conditional operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.
//The conditional operator is also known as the ternary operator because it uses three operands.
const x = 10;
const y = 20;
const z = 30;
const result = x > y ? "x is greater than y" : "x is less than or equal to y";
console.log(result);
